Build a real AI-powered homework helper website called “SnapSolve AI”.

IMPORTANT:
This is NOT a demo or example project.
This must actually solve the user’s question correctly.
Do NOT use placeholder answers.
Do NOT reuse the same solution for different questions.

--------------------------------
WEBSITE PURPOSE
--------------------------------
SnapSolve AI helps school students (Class 3–12) understand homework by showing:
- Correct solutions
- Real calculations
- Clear step-by-step explanations
- Final answers that actually match the question

--------------------------------
PAGES & FLOW
--------------------------------

1) LOGIN PAGE
- Simple login (email + password)
- Also include “Continue as Guest”
- After login or guest click, redirect to Home
- NEVER redirect back to login again

2) HOME PAGE
- Welcome message
- Short explanation:
  “SnapSolve AI helps you solve homework step by step in simple words.”
- Subject selection (MANDATORY):
  • Mathematics
  • Physics
  • Chemistry
  • Biology
  • English
  • Social Science
- Class selection dropdown:
  Class 3 to Class 12
- Button: “Start Solving”

3) SOLVER PAGE
- Textarea for typing questions
- Working image upload button (file picker must open)
- Button: “Solve Step-by-Step”

--------------------------------
AI CORE BEHAVIOR (MOST IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

The AI MUST:
- Read the user’s exact question
- Solve ONLY what is asked
- Use ONLY relevant rules or formulas
- NEVER use example answers
- NEVER reuse previous solutions
- NEVER show unrelated formulas
- NEVER give motivational or generic advice

If the question is simple:
Example: 2 + 2
→ Answer directly with correct steps.

If the question is complex:
→ Explain slowly, step by step.

--------------------------------
SOLUTION FORMAT (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------

Your Question:
<repeat the exact user question>

Step-by-Step Solution:
1) Explain what is given in the question.
2) Explain which rule or concept is used (only if needed).
3) Perform the calculation clearly.
4) Show intermediate steps if required.

Final Answer:
<correct final answer only>

--------------------------------
STRICT RULES
--------------------------------
- Do NOT output fake values like “42”
- Do NOT output “example solution”
- Do NOT use formulas that are not required
- Do NOT ask the student to think or try again
- Do NOT give study advice instead of solving

--------------------------------
SUBJECT & CLASS ADAPTATION
--------------------------------
- Explanations must change based on selected class
- Class 3–6: very simple words, fewer steps
- Class 7–10: clear steps + rules
- Class 11–12: proper formulas + explanation

--------------------------------
DESIGN
--------------------------------
- Clean, student-friendly UI
- Soft colors (blue / white)
- Rounded cards and buttons
- Easy navigation
- Mobile responsive

--------------------------------
FINAL GOAL
--------------------------------
SnapSolve AI must behave like a real teacher solving problems on a board,
not like a demo, not like a chatbot, and not like a motivational guide.
